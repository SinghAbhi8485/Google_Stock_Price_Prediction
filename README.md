Google Stock Price Prediction ML Project

Introduction:
Google Stock Price Prediction ML Project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the future prices of Google's stock based on historical data. This project utilizes time series analysis and machine learning algorithms to forecast the stock prices, providing valuable insights for investors and financial analysts.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to:

Collect and preprocess historical stock price data of Google.
Build and evaluate a machine learning model for stock price prediction.
Provide actionable insights based on the predicted stock prices.
Dataset:
The dataset used for this project comprises historical stock price data of Google, including features such as opening price, closing price, high price, low price, and trading volume. The data is collected from reliable financial data sources or APIs.

Approach:

Data Preprocessing: The historical stock price data undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering to prepare it for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Additional features such as moving averages, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis scores may be derived to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Model Development: Machine learning models including linear regression, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks are trained on the preprocessed data for stock price prediction.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the prediction model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).
Interpretation and Insights: Analysis of predicted stock prices provides insights into potential trends, patterns, and investment opportunities for stakeholders.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
TensorFlow (for LSTM models)
